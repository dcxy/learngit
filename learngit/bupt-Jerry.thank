Dear Liao:
	I am a graduate student from Beijing Univ. of Posts and Telecom. I followed your weibo and knew you are also graduated form BUPT. I learned a lot from your blog teaching Git. It is amazing that I find most of technique blogs are written by allumnus of our school.


Best wished!
Have a nice day!
