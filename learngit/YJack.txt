Hello, Mr Liao. When I meet your blog, I begin to know that GIT is so powerful! It's far more better than SVN.
I'm not so clever as some friends. I spend whole week to understand you lesson. It really helps me.
Thank you from deep of my heart, Mr. Liao! You are such a great man! I wish you a happy life and job!
