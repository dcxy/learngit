this is a good introduction for a beginner especially for a chinese beginner since it is 
written in chinese!haha!

This introduction introduce the basic concepts and practice commands.
as a beginner, maybe we can first learn this intro,
for advanced learning, maybe some other git books are needed!


Thanks very much for this excellent book!
