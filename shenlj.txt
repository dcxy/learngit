Hello michaelliao!
Your tutorial about git is the best one of all the tutorials about git which I have seen.
Before attending this course, I knew only a little like 'push' and 'commit'.
But now, I have know well about more powerful skills -- branch, tag and so on.
Git is really an awesome version control system!
Thanks for teaching how to use git!
