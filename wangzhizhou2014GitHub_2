This is my second time to study your git tutorial, and I reach the topic "Use GitHub" again.
This time I get more knowledge about git not only from your tutorial, but also from a book named "Pro Git". 
After compared your tutorial and that book, I still think yours are better, though that book digs deeper in the inner rules that git follow.

And I decide to read you tutorial the third time after I digest that harder book. 
I believe that I will contribute something  to your tutorial at that time.
Because I really want to do something to let other people accept git more quickly and widely as well as easily. 
At this point, I think we each other can join our hands.
