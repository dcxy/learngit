Preserve notes of Git learning

I am a beginner in git-learing.
I am a Chinese student, and my English is poor.
But I will try my best to discribe my points and ideas in English.
Because I want to imporve my English level in many ways including this, and I also
know that English sometimes can express somethings very well, and even better than 
my mother language, Chinese.

I am a Beginner in git-learning. And i am learning git from a web site named 
"廖雪峰的官方网站", http://www.liaoxuefeng.com/wiki/0013739516305929606dd18361248578c67b8067c8c017b000 .
It is such a useful tutorial of git-learning to a beginner like me that I figured out 
many difficulties thanks to it. 

Git is a version control system. Like SVN but better than SVN, git is a distributed 
system, and is a convenient tool for everyone, especially most programmers and writers. 
You can use branches easily by git, and you will never be worried about your lost 
documents. What's more, you can clone other's respository from the origin repository 
easily. So it allows many partners to collabroate one project and everyone will not 
incluence other people.

In one word, git is a very very convenient tools for us. Let's use it together.
