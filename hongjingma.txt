Just want to say thanks!

When I began to learn GIT/PYTHON, it was quite frustrating (well... my major is not CS or CS related...). But things was changed when I found your blog. Learning Git becomes so fun and so easy for the first time! 

Can not wait to say thanks (no matter you can see this or not...)
