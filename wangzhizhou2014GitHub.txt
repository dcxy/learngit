Git is very interesting.

Thanks for your hardwork that let me mastered a new skill.

The first time I know the GitHub when I read a book named "Orange S: The implement of an operating system" which written by a Chinese named YuYuan. Then I search on the internet for the new term. Fortunately, I found your tutorial for Git. After one hour reading, I found that I love the powerful software and your style of writing. Thank you again!

And when I write this letter, you know I will read over your tutorial about git no longer.

I just want to say: Thank you very much!
I will let more people know your tutorial and you web site.
