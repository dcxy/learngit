thanks for your git tutor!
i learned this tutor in last four days and it is easy for me to understand 
the special concepts about Gitwith ur help.And i learned a lot about github,it helps me to find what i needed.
To me,git looks like a good assistant to preserve files,and i can modify and approve my codes at ease. It looks like ctrl+z operation,but it has some diffrent feature distinguish from ctrl+z .
Up to today ,i have learnt all of ur tutor lessons about python,git js,thanks for ur free teaching!
