I'm a new soul
I came to this strange world
Hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take
But since I came here
I felt the joy and fear
Finding myself making every possible mistakes
Lalalala lalalalalala

See I'm a young soul in this very strange world
Hoping I could learn a bit about what is true and fake
But why all this hate
Try to communicate
Finding trust and love is not always easy to make
Lalalala lalalalalala

Wakeup every morning with hope and love for life -- CaptainJe
