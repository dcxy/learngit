NEW YORK-Ryan McCarthy, an assistant editor on The New York Times national desk,
 has been named editor-in-chief of Vice News, according to a memo obtained by The Huffington Post. 
The move comes as Editor-in-Chief Jason Mojica shifts over to the television side of Vice as head 
of international coverage for its forthcoming nightly HBO news show. 
Vice, which already has a weekly newsmagazine on HBO, has not yet 
announced a start date for the program it first announced plans for a year ago. 
Former Bloomberg executive Josh Tyrangiel, who joined Vice in October to oversee 
the program, said in a memo that the new hires are part of the company's plan to "ramp up toward launch of the Vice nightly show on HBO."
McCarthy, who previously worked at The Huffington Post, Reuters and The Washington Post, joined the Times’ audience development team last year.
He’s the second Times staffer to join Vice this past week. Times media reporter Ravi Somaiya joined Vice as a tech corresponden
t for the HBO programs, according to the memo. 
Tyrangiel also announced that Fusion’s Javier Guzman is joining as senior producer for U.S. news,
Christina Vallice of “NBC Nightly News” is joining as supervising producer focused on breaking news, 
and Jessica Weisberg, who most recently worked on the second season of “Serial,” comes aboard as 
supervising producer focused on the nightly show’s long-lead stories.
